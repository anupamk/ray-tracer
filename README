 Description
=============
Simple ray-tracer with some tests

 How To
========
   A.  Building
      ----------
        Note: We are using cmake for building the whole thing.

        - Create a directory where all generated files will be placed, and
          change to that directory, and generate the Makefiles:

            $ mkdir build && cd build
            $ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"

        - Parallel builds are supported, so, just do (8 == number of
          cores on this machine)
            $ make -j 8

        Once the last step completes (successfully), following
        executable files are generated:

            - build/test/ray-tracer-test ........................ ray tracer tests
            - build/src/virtual-cannon .......................... trace virtual cannonball on ppm canvas
            - build/src/ray-tracer .............................. just a place holder
            - build/src/clock-dial .............................. clock dial using matrix transforms on ppm canvas
            - build/src/sphere-silhouette ....................... silhouette of a sphere on ppm canvas
            - build/src/phong-sphere ............................ phong shaded sphere on sdl2 canvas

    B. Running
      ---------
        Run any of the programs listed above...
