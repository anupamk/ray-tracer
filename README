 Description
=============
Simple ray-tracer with some tests

 How To
========
   A.  Building
      ----------
        Note: We are using cmake for building the whole thing.

        - Create a directory where all generated files will be placed, and
          change to that directory

            $ mkdir raytracer-build && cd raytracer-build

        - Now, generate the makefiles
            $ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"

        - Build everything
            $ cmake --build .

        Once the last step completes, following executable files are
        generated ($PWD == 'raytracer-build'):

            - $PWD/src/ray-tracer       : ray-tracer
            - $PWD/test/ray-tracer-test : ray-tracer-test
