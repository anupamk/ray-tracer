	 * this file describes uv-mapper routines for various shapes. uv-mapper
	 * is a function (in true sense of that word) mapping a 3d-point (on a
	 * shape) to a corresponding uv-point on the texture.
	 *
	 * thus, all uv-mapper routines look like instances of this:
	 *        std::function<uv_point(tuple const&)>
	 *
	 * once a uv-point is obtained, the texture color (at that uv-point) is
	 * applied to the surface that is being rendered.
